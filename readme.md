# JTween

## About
JTween is a data-driven, job-based tweening library. It places a focus on performance by attempting to shift the processing of tween data and applying that data to tween targets on Job threads. This currently applies to Transforms only, but as the Entity-Component System of the Unity DOTS stack reaches maturity this approach can likely be applied to other components.
