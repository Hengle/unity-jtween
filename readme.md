# JTween

## About
**JTween** is a data-driven, job-based tweening library. It places a focus on performance by attempting to shift the processing of tween data and applying that data to tween targets on Job threads. This currently applies to Transforms only, but as the Entity-Component System of the Unity **DOTS** stack reaches maturity this approach can likely be applied to other components.

You can read more about my experience porting my previous tween engine to leverage Unity's **DOTS**, now named **JTween** here https://www.jeffcampbellmakes.games/blog/2019/5/26/diving-in-headfirst-unitys-job-system-and-jtween.
